```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  let ys = sort xs
  print ys
```
This code has a subtle issue if the list `xs` is very large, or contains elements that are computationally expensive to compare.  The `sort` function uses a merge sort which, while efficient on average (O(n log n)), can still be slow for particularly large or complex inputs.  Moreover, if the elements are not comparable (for instance, if you're comparing custom data types without an appropriate `Ord` instance), this will cause a runtime error.

The underlying issue is the choice of sorting algorithm and the lack of explicit error handling for non-comparable elements. This might not show up in small examples, but is a real concern in production code.
